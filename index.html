                <h2>Nature</h2>
                <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural world, physical universe, material world or material
                    universe. "Nature" refers to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
                    Manufactured objects and human interaction are, in common usage, not considered part of nature
                    unless qualified in ways such as "human nature" or "the whole of nature". Nature is generally
                    distinguished from the supernatural. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the galactic.</p>

                <h2>Earth</h2>
                <p>Earth (or, "the earth")the fifth largest planet in the solar system, third in order of distance from
                    the Sun. It is the largest of its planetary system's terrestrial planets and the only place in the
                    universe known to support life.</p>
                <p>The most prominent features of the earth's climate are its two large polar regions, two relatively
                    narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region. Precipitation patterns
                    vary widely according to location, ranging from several metres of water per year to less than a
                    millimetre. About 70 percent of the surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists
                    of continents and islands, with the vast majority of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.
                </p>
                <h2>Life</h2>
                <p>Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that
                    the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth,
                    adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction. Life may also be said to be simply the
                    characteristic state of organisms.</p>
